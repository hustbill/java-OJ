Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?

For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \

    /     /       \                 \

	 * Taking 1~n as root respectively:
	 *      1 as root: # of trees = F(0) * F(n-1)  // F(0) == 1
	 *      2 as root: # of trees = F(1) * F(n-2) 
	 *      3 as root: # of trees = F(2) * F(n-3)
	 *      ...
	 *      n-1 as root: # of trees = F(n-2) * F(1)
	 *      n as root:   # of trees = F(n-1) * F(0)
	 *
	 * So, the formulation is:
	 *      F(n) = F(0) * F(n-1) + F(1) * F(n-2) + F(2) * F(n-3) + ... + F(n-2) * F(1) + F(n-1) * F(0)

	 * G(n): the number of unique BST for a sequence of length n.
	 * 
	 * F(i, n), 1 <= i <= n: the number of unique BST, where the number i is the
	 * root of BST, and the sequence ranges from 1 to n.
	 * 
	 * G(n), is the sum of BST F(i) using each number i as a root. i.e. G(n) =
	 * F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n).
	 * 
	 * To construct an unique BST out of the entire sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
	 * 7] with 3 as the root, which is to say, we need to construct an unique
	 * BST out of its left subsequence [1, 2] and another BST out of the right
	 * subsequence [4, 5, 6, 7], and then combine them together (i.e. cartesian
	 * product). 
	 * 
	 * The tricky part is that we could consider the number of unique
	 * BST out of sequence [1,2] as G(2), and the number of of unique BST out of
	 * sequence [4, 5, 6, 7] as G(4). Therefore, F(3,7) = G(2) * G(4).
	 * 
	 * F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i) 1 <= i <= n Combining the above two formulas,
	 * we obtain the recursive formula for G(n). i.e.
	 * 
	 * G(n) = G(0) * G(n-1) + G(1) * G(n-2) + â€¦ + G(n-1) * G(0)
