 * Total Submissions: 963.6K
 * Testcase Example:  '[0,1,0,3,12]'
 *
 * Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while
 * maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
 * Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
 * Minimize the total number of operations.

class Solution {
     // Approach 1: Two pointer approach
    // The fast pointer which is denoted by variable "cur" does the job of processing new elements

    // Time : O(N), Space: 0(1)

        int lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0;
        // If the current element is not 0, then we need to
        // append it just in front of last non 0 element we found.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt++] = nums[i];
            }
        }

        // After we have finished processing new elements,
        // all the non-zero elements are alreay at beginning of array.
        // We just need to fill remaining array with 0's.
