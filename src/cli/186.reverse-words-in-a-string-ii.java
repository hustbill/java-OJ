 *
 * Given an input string , reverse the string word by word. 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
 * Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
 * 
 * Note: 
 * 
 * 
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
 * The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 * The words are always separated by a single space.
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
