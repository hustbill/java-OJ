## Validate the .classpath 
before import this project java-oj into Eclipse, we need to validate the content of .classpath. 

* 2020-1-05   
There is an issue on my .classpath, it is a merge info in this file.  
Ref to link [Eclipse “Error: Could not find or load main class”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11235827/eclipse-error-could-not-find-or-load-main-class/27488594)

## Solution:
fix the merge, then the package  can be running now.
