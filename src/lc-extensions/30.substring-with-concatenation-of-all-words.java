 * Testcase Example:  '"barfoothefoobarman"\n["foo","bar"]'
 *
 * You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the
 * same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a
 * concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening
 * characters.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠ s = "barfoothefoobarman",
 * ⁠ words = ["foo","bar"]
 * Output: [0,9]
 * Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar"
 * respectively.
 * The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * ⁠ s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
 * ⁠ words = ["word","good","best","word"]
 * Output: []
 * 
 *
