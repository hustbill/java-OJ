{PhoneNumber} is the phone number you are requesting information about. Phone numbers can be specified either in national formatting or in standard E.164 format. If providing a number in local national format, please also specify the country as an optional parameter. If no country is provided, this will default to US. Twilio will use libphonenumber, Google’s open source phone number handling library, to properly format possible phone numbers for a given region, using length and prefix.

HTTP GET
